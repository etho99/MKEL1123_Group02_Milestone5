## Image Classification on Freshness of Fruits and Vegetables
> This README file documented the [equipment used](#hardware) and the detail procedure including [configuring Edge Impulse interface](#image-classification-using-edge-impulse), [exporting CMSIS pack to STM32CubeIDE](#deployment-of-cmsis-pack-from-edge-impulse-to-stm32cubeide) and [LED configuration](#led-and-button-pre-work) before integrating with the other subsystem. Though we could not properly implement the integration of the subsystem due to distance-learning and time-constraint, the [proposed code integration] () is still documented to be further tested.

## Image Classification Using Edge Impulse 
A complete tutorial on how to classify images in Edge Impulse is well-documented by the vendor in https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tutorials/image-classification  

Thus, only the essential methodology to be mindful of is highlighted:
